Hi, I am Ahmet Firat Gamsiz, a senior computer engineering student at Bogazici University. My research interests are AI applications in education and creativity, specializing in language models. Currently, I am applying for funded MSc and PhD positions in these areas.

I have been working in the CoLoRs lab for a year, led by Prof. Emre Uğur, where I work on LLM implementations of robotics. My current work is implementing a framework for task detection and inverse task planning with vision language models. 

I did a summer internship at CIS@LMU Munich, which is led by Prof. Hinrich Schütze. With my PhD advisor, Abdullatif Köksal, I developed a framework to generate an educational conversation dataset of 40k size. You can access the paper under progress, "May I Ask a Question? MIA40K: A Large-Scale Educational Conversation Dataset and Generation Pipeline" from [here](https://ahmetfirat23.github.io/publication/MIA).

My senior project is investigating AI in education topics, mainly focusing on step by step solution generation for geometry questions. This project aims to combine VLMs with diffusion models to generate geometric primitives. This project is co-supervised by Prof. Suzan Üsküdarlı and Abdullatif Köksal.
